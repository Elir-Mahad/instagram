	// This is for signing up a new user via the modal.
	// The modal is a popup that appears when the Sign up button is clicked.

	//! ----------FIRST USE EFFECT BELOW - UseEffect runs a piece of code based on a specific condition

			// this will fire off every single time any authentication change happens

			if (authUser) {
				// if the user has logged in
				console.log(authUser);
				// console.log that that user is logged in
				setUser(authUser);
				// capture that user inside of our state.
				// This also ensures that user data survives refresh.
				// Ex: if max is logged in and then he refreshed,
				// react will be able to see that hes still logged in, because it uses cookie tracking
				// and then it would set the state(as being logged in).
			} else {
				// if the user has logged out
				setUser(null);
				// set the user to null
			}
		});

		return () => {
			// perform some cleanup actions

			unsubscribe();
		};

		// Unlike the next useEffect below
		// we don't want to run this code only once when the app component loads, and don't run it again.
		// In this situation, since we are repeteadly updating the user and username,
		// we want this useEffect to be fired of everytime the user/username changes.
		// Hence, we have to the include them as dependencies.
	}, [user, username]);

	//! -----------SECOND USE EFFECT BELOW - UseEffect runs a piece of code based on a specific condition

	useEffect(

			db.collection("posts")
				// Get the posts inside firebase
				.orderBy("timestamp", "desc")
				// order the posts based on timestamp in descending order (top post = most recent post)
				.onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
					// Use onsnapshot
					// Onsnapshot is a really powerful listener
					// every single time the data base changes in that collection,
					// every single time a document gets added, modified, changed inside a post,
					// a camera is going to take a snapshot of exactly what that data collection looks like
					setPosts(
						snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
							// from that snapshot, get all documents, map through every single document((snapshot.docs.map((doc))
							id: doc.id,
							// get the documents id  (in firebase database, the id is the number under the add document tab)
							post: doc.data()
							// get the document data (doc.data) --> data includes each docs properties and values (caption, username, image, etc )
						}))
					);
				});
		},
		// the below line means: whenever the page refreshs, and the conditional is satisfied,
		// run this code only once when the app component loads, and don't run it again.
		// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
		[]

	//! -----------BELOW IS THE SIGN UP FUNCTION - THIS IS USED TO SIGN NEW USERS UP

	const signUp = (event) => {

		event.preventDefault();
		// this stops the form for acting weird

		auth()
			.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)

				authUser.user.updateProfile({
					displayName: username
				});
			})

			.catch((error) => alert(error.message));
